<p>The core business of Healthcare Services is the employer funded integrated healthcare model, which is offered as a subscription and medical insurance to client companiesâ€™ employees or to individual clients. The need for these services is driven by employers wanting to attract good employees, keep them healthy and motivated, and ensure that if they did become ill they will quickly receive the treatment needed in order to return to full health. This is a business that both finances and delivers the healthcare.</p>

<p>Medicover entered the market for employer funded healthcare services in Poland in 1995, and subsequently took this same business model to Romania. The integrated healthcare model provides steady and predictable revenues and high customer loyalty. At the end of 2023 Healthcare Services provided care to 1,700,000 members. There are various ways to become one of our members. The majority of our customers are companies buying group prepaid benefit plans for their employees. We sell group insurances and individual insurances as well. We also welcome patients on a fee-for-service basis and provide selected services under the contract with national health funds.</p>

<p>Most employers in the countries where Medicover operates chose to provide their employees with ambulatory healthcare, both primary care and some specialist care, because these are the services which the employees are most likely to need. However, many individuals and some employers wish to ensure access to a broader range of specialist ambulatory services, and to hospital care as well. It is the demand for these services that led Medicover to expand into hospital care and to broaden the range of specialist care provided.</p>
